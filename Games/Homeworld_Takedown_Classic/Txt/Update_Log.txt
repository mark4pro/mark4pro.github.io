*Note*
There may still be more updates out
while I work on the new game.
I'm doing this to fix old bugs and
"keep it up to date" and make it less
of a pain to manage it. I do have plans
for this game even after the new game
releases. I'll go ahead and say that
save exporting will be implemented at
some point with rewards for doing so.
I don't know when it's going to be
implemented since to demo isn't out
yet but sometime after that.

What's new in V0.5.5-
   Updated assets
   Cleaned and fixed audio code
   Cleaned up code

Last Update-
   Fixed bullet sound
   New animation system
   Code clean up
