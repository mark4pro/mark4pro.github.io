OLD:
		The website got some visual changes!
		Add a "new" game called Tank War X Line Battle X Ball Bouncers
		This a minigame collection that combines and adds some stuff to
	my old minigames. Right now only Line Battle is playable! I also removed 
	the old versions of Line Battle and Tank War off of the website.
	
THOUGHTS:
		Homeworld Takedown Classic is getting updates that back ports a lot
	of things from the new build to satisfy people while I'm working on the
	new version since it's going to be a while until it's ready.
		SlayTheCube will be getting a few more updates soon. (maybe an engine swap)
		I have plans to make a Java version of SlayTheCube.
		SlayTheCube 2 is on hold at the moment and will be completely
	rebuilt using a newer engine.
		Minigame Collection is on hold at the moment until I'm further along in
	the developement of Homeworld Takedown V0.6. The UI will most likely be rebuilt
	from the ground up.
		Work on Task Force 271 will be halted until further notice.
		I'm cancelling the fighting game I had plans on making.
		After I'm done with Homeworld Takedown V0.6 I'm going to
	take a small break and update some older projects and then start
	a big push to finish the 13 waves in the campaign. When the campaign
	is finished I plan on seeing if endless mode is possible. I'll have a
	few other things to get finished before launch before I start polishing
	the game but after that I'll be done!
		I plan on making a Supporter edition of Homeworld Takedown that
	will come with more gameplay and features that you don't get in the base
	game. This will go into production after I get things settled with the
	launch of the base game.
