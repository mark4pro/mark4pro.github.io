	A new Homeworld Takedown update is coming soon.
	I'll start working on Task Force 271 after I finally finish work on
	Tank War and Line Battle. I'm looking forward to sharing more with you
	on this next year!
	There's a fighting game coming in beta next year!
	After I'm done with the whole Homeworld Takedown Preview update
