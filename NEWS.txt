***NEWS***

NEW:
	New- The website got some visual changes!
	New- Add a "new" game called Tank War X Line Battle X Ball Bouncers
	This a minigame collection that combines and adds some stuff to my old
	minigames. Right now only Line Battle is playable! I also removed 
	the old versions of Line Battle and Tank War off of the website.

OLD:
	The News feature got some well deserved bug fixes!
	SlayTheCube got a update! (V3 "OK update")
	SlayTheCube:
		*fixed text alignment
		*disabled touch actions (like double tap)
		*reset button resets the game when you reach the end
		*optimized more of the code
		*when you collide with "ammo" it auto fires
		*simplified the controls
	
THOUGHTS:
	Line Battle might get one more major update sometime soon.
	Tank War is going to be getting an update soon.
	SlayTheCube 2 is getting modding support in the next major update!
	I'm working on modding tools for SlayTheCube 2.
	A new Homeworld Takedown update is coming soon.
	I'll start working on Task Force 271 after I finally finish work on
	Tank War and Line Battle. I'm looking forward to sharing more with you
	on this next year!
	There's a fighting game coming in beta next year!
	After I'm done with the whole Homeworld Takedown Preview update
	I'm going to start a big push to finish the 13 waves in the campaign.
	(a total of 20) After that I'll work on the endless mode that's coming,
	then event and polish will be my main objective.
