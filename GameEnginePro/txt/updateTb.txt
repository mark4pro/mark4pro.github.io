:TYPE P AS YOUR NAME TO TOGGLE THE PIB:

WHAT'S NEW IN V0.4.93

Well just look at it! Isn't it great!
This update was kind of a quality of life inprovement.
You can also toggle this amazing Patch Info board here if type PIB or pib in the name box.
The page looks different and also the UI and upgrade menu.
I also made the Patch Info Board appear when you load the webpage untill sunday the 8th which is important because I can add time sensitive events like special boss fights and more!!!

This is one step closer to V0.5.0 the next big update should be the wave 5 - 7 level design!
