:PRESS P TO TOGGLE THE PIB:

WHAT'S NEW IN V0.4.93

Well just look at it! Isn't it great!
This update was kind of a quality of life inprovement.
You can now mute and unmute the in game music and sounds by toggle using m on your keyboard.
You can also toggle this amazing Patch Info board here if you like using p on your keyboard.
The page looks different and also the UI and upgrade menu.
I also added a UI element so you know the sound is muted or not.
I sized up the screen and made sure the scaling didn't make the game look bad by some css magic!
Also the page element are moved around.
I also made the Patch Info Board appear when you load the webpage untill sunday the 8th which is important because I can add time sensitive events like special boss fights and more!!!

This is one step closer to V0.5.0 the next big update should be the wave 5 - 7 level design! 

:In The Future!:
So I have a lot of plans for this game! 
Some will be added. (most will) 
Somethings that are coming in the near future:
Secret weapons from bosses or events!
Saving secret weapons so you don't loose them when you come back.
Special event and limited time events!
Themed stages.
Endless mode! (with 3 difficulties)
Different ships! (maybe with differant stats but mostly cosmetic)
Story (It will be a clip to tell you the story of the game so far)
Special weapon vault (It will show you what all you're missing)
Stats command (type this in and it will tell you the stats of your current weapon) (coming very soon)
