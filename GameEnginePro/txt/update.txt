WHAT'S NEW IN V0.4.93

Well just look at it! Isn't it great!
This update was kind of a quality of life inprovement.
You can now mute and unmute the in game music and sounds by toggle using m on your keyboard.
You can also toggle this amazing Patch Info board here if you like using p on your keyboard.
The page looks different and also the UI and upgrade menu.
I also added a UI element so you know the sound is muted or not.
I sized up the screen and made sure the scaling didn't make the game look bad by some css magic!
Also the page element are moved around.

This is one step closer to V0.5.0 the next big update should be the wave 5 - 7 level design!
